This is my first blog, I'd like to do a brief introducation for me.

I got a Master degree in Fluid Mechanics from CAS (Chinese Acedmy of Sciences) in 2024, where I focused on Renewable Energy Computation and Turbulence, which is a unforgetable time for my life.
Later, I toke into a Phd project of another University in a few time which is about therotical fluid, but actually it's just for paper-writing although I'm clear I know nothing about that subject.
Soon, I realized Appied Scientist is my persional dream, but this project has no helf for me even waste time, so I quit.
Now I'm worked as a Algorithm Engineer about Mathematics package, I hope it's a good chance for me to learn knowledge and establish my dream structle.
In future, if I'm necessary for a Phd degree and there is a suit oppunturity, maybe I would try again.

And then, I want to explain the reason that I make personal website.

Reason 1, I would share my work thought online. There is a mount of clear guys, if they are instrested, their feedback is helpful for me.
Reason 2, I do like code fluid simulation program which is beautiful and amazing, but sometime i will be lazy. So recording my learning and coding online is good way to fix this.
