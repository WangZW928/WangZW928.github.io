This is my first blog, and I'd like to briefly introduce myself.

I obtained a Master's degree in Fluid Mechanics from CAS (Chinese Academy of Sciences) in 2024, where I focused on renewable energy computation and turbulence. It was an unforgettable period in my life.
Later, I briefly joined a PhD program at another university, working on theoretical fluid mechanics. However, the project was mostly focused on paper-writing, and I clearly knew very little about the subject.
Soon, I realized that becoming an applied scientist is my personal dream. Since the project offered no help toward that goal and was actually wasting my time, I decided to quit.
Now, I work as an algorithm engineer in the field of mathematical software. I hope this is a great opportunity for me to gain knowledge and lay the foundation for my dream.
In the future, if a PhD degree becomes necessary and the right opportunity arises, I might consider trying again.

I also want to explain why I decided to create a personal website.

Reason 1: I want to share my thoughts and work online. There are many brilliant people out there, and if any of them are interested, their feedback could be very helpful to me.
Reason 2: I truly enjoy coding fluid simulation programsâ€”they are both beautiful and fascinating. However, I sometimes get lazy. Recording my learning and coding progress online is a good way to keep myself motivated.
